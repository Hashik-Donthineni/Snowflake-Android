> Implementing Snowflake proxy on the Android platform as a native
> application for volunteer users to contribute as a relay and help
> circumvent censorship. With the ubiquitous nature of Android phones, it makes perfect sense to develop a mobile version of the proxy that relays the data in the background, which adds to the currently active volunteer proxies making Snowflake proxy abundantly available at all times.
  
 

## Building and Running
The build process is similar to any other Android application. \
[Snowbox](https://github.com/cohosh/snowbox) is a Docker container that is used to test broker API, simulate a client. It makes developmen smooth. 


## Contribution
Download Android studio, import the project, set-up Snowbox, you are good to go! \
To feel comfortable around the code base I strongly suggest taking a lookg at the project [Wiki](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake-mobile/-/wikis/home).
