## Building and Running
The build process is similar to any other Android application. \
To be able to test broker API, simulate a client, you can use [Snowbox](https://github.com/cohosh/snowbox). It is a Docker container that is used to fulfill the said tasks and makes development smooth.


## Contribution
Download Android studio, import the project, set-up Snowbox, you are good to go! to feel comfortable around the code base I strongly suggest taking a lookg at the [Wiki](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake-mobile/-/wikis/home).

## Contact  
You can use [Tor OFTC IRC](https://www.torproject.org/contact/) to contact the people at Tor and get to know the dev team.  
If you want to contact me exclusively you can email me at HashikDonthineni(@)Gmail(dot)com \
