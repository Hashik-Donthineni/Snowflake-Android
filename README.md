Implementing Snowflake proxy on the Android platform as a native application for volunteer users to contribute as a proxy and help circumvent censorship. The goal is to leverage the ubiquitous nature of Android phones; A proxy relays the data to Tor in the background on mobile phones, which adds to the currently active volunteer proxies making Snowflake proxy abundantly available at all times.

# Project under development. Works only locally at this moment.
